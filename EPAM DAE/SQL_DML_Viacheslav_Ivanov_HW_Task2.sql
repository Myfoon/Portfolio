/*I created table "table_to_delete" with Stage_1 query. With the help of Stage_2 I determined that the table consumes 575 MB.
 * I performed DELETE FROM using Stage_3 query. Duration of this operation was 13298 ms. I repeated Stage_2 and it appeared that the table
 * consumed the same 575 Mb as we had before DELETE. After that Stage_4 (VACUUM) was performed. In its results we note the number of 
 * 1660896 removable row versions. Unsurprisingly, it is the number of rows which were removed with DELETE FROM operation, but were still
 * presented as "dead" tuples. As far as VACUUM reclaims storage occupied by dead tuples, when we repeat Stage_2 we discover that table size
 * decreased to 383 mb (exactly 2/3 of 575 mb). 
 * I recreated table "table_to_delete", and performed Stage_5 operation - TRUNCATE. Its duration was 1067 ms, which is about 13 times less than DELETE FROM.
 * As we know, DELETE is basically a row level operation. A DELETE statement marks every row matching the WHERE-clause as deleted.In the case of big amount of rows,
 * this takes a relatively long time. TRUNCATE is different: Itâ€™s basically a table operation. Instead of touching each row separately, it simply empties the entire table, 
 * which is significally faster. If we check space consumption of the table once again with Stage_2 query, we will see that it is roughly equal to 0. It is evidence 
 * of the fact that it reclaims disk space immediately and doesn't require subsequent VACUUM operation. 
 * To sum up, TRUNCATE is unbeatable if we need to delete all rows, it is considerably faster than DELETE and doen't require VACUUM afterwards. On the other hand, if we need 
 * to remove rows selectively, we have to use DELETE with its disadvantages (longer execution time, necessity to use VACUUM afterwards to reclaim disk space).
